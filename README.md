# Introduction
Taipan is a Python based programming language build for an easy to understand source-code. Taipan is inspired by Basic, but is actually Basic. But instead of it being just Basic, we are also inspired by Python. 

Taipan is designed to be understandble. Also for people who are not known with code. Our mission is for anyone to understand what the code will output, even if they have never worked with a programming language!

But of course like any programming language that requires a good set of docs so you can understand how to use it. And the Taipan version is right here in the readme! We are working on a more detailed and better doc and you can expect that to release soon. 

Now, for the practial information. As mentioned before Taipan is inspired by basic and that allows it to be understandble. And for someone who has worked with code before this doc will be overkill. But for new comers to the language or just code in general, here are the docs.

Quick word before we start. We would like to thank you for choosing Taipan and trying it out! We hope you have a great expierence with Taipan. We are realising updates on the regular. 

To people with ideas. If you have any plan on how you'd like to see the language change. Let us know! We would love to upgrade our language and making it more user friendly.

As mentioned Taipan is inspired by Basic. So a lot of things will be simulair. But there is a mix of Python thrown in there, and we are working on giving it it's own 'twist'. We 

Taipan knows all the letters and numbers of the English alphabet. And you can use all of those.

# Installation

There are few ways to install Taipai. The first being downloading the code and running it inside of your terminal. This is not the most efficient way but for some people the source code can be needed. You are free to download the code in this rep.

You need to put all of the code into a folder and than run `shell.py` with your favorite code editor.

This will open up terminal and write `taipan ~ >` which means it is ready to go. From that point you can write your code and type enter and your code will be processed.

`Taipan IDE` 

The second way, and also the way we recommand you download, is by downloading the Taipan IDE. Which includes the language. This is just clicking the download button and following the set-up.
