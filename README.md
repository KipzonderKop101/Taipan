# Introduction
Taipan is a Python based programming language build for an easy to understand source-code. Taipan is inspired by Basic, but is actually Basic. But instead of it being just Basic, we are also inspired by Python. 

Taipan is designed to be understandble. Also for people who are not known with code. Our mission is for anyone to understand what the code will output, even if they have never worked with a programming language!
